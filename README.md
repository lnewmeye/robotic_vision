# Robotic Vision Repository

This repository is for Luke Newmeyer's BYU EcEn 631 Robotic Vision class. Each subfolder contains a project used for each of the various assignments. Team projects (done with James Swift) are kept in a separate repository.

Included in the root folder is the [chess_board.pdf](chess_board.pdf). This is needed for several of assignments/projects.

## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 comprises the **ball_detection** and **feature_tracking** projects. These projects were developed in Microsoft Visual Studios 2015 Community Edition. The code, however, should be completely compatible with any general C++ compiler.

Since the completion of the assignment, the **feature_tracking** project has been ported to Linux. The ported code is in the **feature_tracking_linux** folder.

## Assignment 2

Assignment 2 is contained in the **camera_calibration** project. The project is somewhat complicated from a user stand point. Refer to the README within the project for help.

## Assignment 3

Assignment 3 is contained in the **stereo_calibration** project.
