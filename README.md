# Robotic Vision Repository

This repository is for Luke Newmeyer's BYU EcEn 631 Robotic Vision class. Each subfolder contains a project used for each of the various assignments. Team projects (done with James Swift) are kept in a separate repository.

## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 comprises the **ball_detection** and **feature_tracking** projects. These projects were developed in Microsoft Visual Studios 2015 Community Edition. The code, however, should be completely compatible with any general C++ compiler.
